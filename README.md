What is Next.js?
Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.

It also automatically configures lower-level tools like bundlers and compilers. You can instead focus on building your product and shipping quickly.

Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Next.js can help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast React applications.

Key Features
File-based Routing: Pages are created in the pages/ directory â€” routes are based on the file structure.

Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Fetch data on each request via getServerSideProps.

Static Site Generation (SSG): Pre-render pages at build time using getStaticProps and getStaticPaths.

API Routes: Build backend endpoints directly within your Next.js app.

Image Optimization: Use the built-in next/image component for responsive images and lazy loading.

App Router (new): As of Next.js 13+, supports a new app/ directory for layouts, nested routing, and React Server Components.

Middleware: Add custom logic (auth, redirects) to run before a request is completed.

Built-in CSS, Sass, Tailwind, and more: Easy styling options, full support for CSS Modules.
